Not sure which is the best file to use. The home computer is one is only one with sites, but need to:



1. find email where Riccardo gave sites
Sept 28 - 2022:

"Hi Ian, all.
Sorry for the delay.
All environmental data I have for the period 2017-2019 are in Maggioni et al (2021) attached https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/18/5117/2021/bg-18-5117-2021.html.
First of all a sum up of the BMU deployment in Bouraké (the natural lab), and at the reference site.
Bouraké B1: 4511-4520; B2: 4521-4525, 4531-4535; between the two sites: st F: 4541-4550
Control (Reference) R2: 4506-4510, 4526-4530; st 69: 4501-4505, 4536-4540
B1, B2 and F have a few differences in pH, T, O2. For the dissolution, in a first attempt we can consider the three sites similar and explore later the eventual environmental differences. If the analysis is also on the organisms fixed on them (the pictures I send you) we will need to explore a bit the data.
R2 should be a control but we discovered that pH is not "normal", i.e., pH 7.89. Station 69 should be the control but I remember I had some problem with pH there, so, I'll collect some news (although some years later!).
I attached here a google earth picture with stations; all the data I have. The BGS paper+supplementary can be downloaded her https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/18/5117/2021/bg-18-5117-2021.html

In all I have good data about pH, DO and temperature plus more on chemicals (see Maggioni et al). Only temperature from St 69.
I hope this can help. Please, ask me for any question about the sites and data interpretation.
Best"


2. ensure Ben's followup corrections are in there
NewCalBMUDataCorrected2 is raw (no sites) from Ben, corrected (notes in QuickNewCalQCReport.docx). NewCalBMUDataCorrected_homeComputer appears to NOT be updated as of the second Ben correction. 

3. confirm files aren't on work computer
No folder on work computer.

4. rename files appropriately

Working from Chomitz correction, updating site names and simplifying. Renaming newCalBarDataFinal



Nov 22 2023
  Removed calculations from newCalBarData Final
  Emailed Ben about 4515 sponge erosion which is blank instead of 0. Changed to 0 but will correct if Ben indicates something different.
